# ✅ Katomaran Todo Task Management App

This is a frontend-only Todo Task Management web app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed for the Katomaran Full Stack Hackathon.

---

## 🔥 Features

- 🧑‍💻 **Simulated Google Login** (no real OAuth, uses localStorage)
- 📋 **CRUD Tasks** – Create, edit, delete tasks
- 🔎 **Filtering** – All tasks, Due Today, Completed, In Progress
- 🎨 **Color-coded badges** – Priority & Status
- 📧 **Simulated Sharing** – Enter an email to "share" a task (stored locally)
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works on both desktop and mobile
- 💾 **Offline Support** – Tasks saved in browser using `localStorage`
- 🚫 No backend or database – completely frontend powered

---

## 🧠 Assumptions

- OAuth login and real-time sync are mocked due to frontend-only tech constraints.
- Data is stored only in `localStorage`; once cleared, data is lost.
- Sharing is simulated with an email field (not actually sent or received).
